#  hand_recognition

This is a project I made about year ago from this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQZ4IvB07ec)

## Installing dependencies
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Usage
```hand_tracking_min_code.py```: detects and tracks landmarks of the human hand in real-time video feed
```hand_tracking_two_fingers_touch.py```: detects and tracks landmarks of the human hand and outputs 'true' when the thumb and index finger are touching
```hand_tracking_module.py```: Makes it possible to use the hand tracking code as a module
